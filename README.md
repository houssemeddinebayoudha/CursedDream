# CursedDream

This game was made for the brackeys game jam where he challenged us to make a game in 7 days. 
# The theme 
### Rewind 
# Description :
I took it literally and made a game in which the character is a teenager boy <br>
who woke up in the dream realm and kept seeking the exit and he found out the chocking truth.
You can also play the web version of the game in my itch.io profile.
