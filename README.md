# CursedDream

This game was made for the brackeys game jam where he challenged us to make a game in 7 days. 
# The theme 
### Rewind 
# Description :
I took it literally and made a game in which the character is a teenager boy <br>
who woke up in the dream realm and kept seeking the exit and he found out the chocking truth.<br>
You can also play the web version of the game in my itch.io profile.<br>
